# KnotesCentral

Welcome to Knotes Central, it is a collaborative student platform created to empower and support fellow students in their academic journey at our college. This initiative is not a competition or a product for commercial use—it's a shared effort to build a resource for academic growth and success. As we approach graduation, our goal is to ensure this platform remains valuable, relevant, and accessible for future batches.
